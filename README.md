# Simple neural network implementation in Python

### Problem description
Implementaion in raw python (using numpy only) neural network with 2 layers (input and output) that
can calculate *and* operation of 2 8-bit numbers.

### Validation
Implemented same neural network in Pytorch and every step is validated during execution.

### Performance
- 98% success for 50 epoches (small batch training, batch size - 32)
- ??% success for 1000 epoches (small batch training, batch size - 64)
